# How to effectively fine-tune AI models using Colab.

## Load Data
- Colab consumes a lot of time when uploading data, so always upload data first.
- In the uploading time, you can prepare the script and environment.

## Find scripts for fine-tuning
- Many fine-tuning scripts tailored for Colab are available online.
- If your model is hosted on Hugging Face, you can often find Colab-compatible scripts directly on the model's page.
- Numerous fine-tuning scripts can be found on platforms like Medium and GitHub. However, these scripts often require adjustments to address compatibility issues with specific Python library versions.

## Fine-tuning Strategy on Colab
### Large Models
- Colab have a daily GPU usage limit (instead of weekly like Kaggle). So its better to use it for debugging and testing scripts:
    + Check library version collisions.
    + Adjust the script to run successfully in one go.
    + You can run it with a small dataset to estimate the time and resources needed.
### Small Models
- Colab is particularly suitable for fine-tuning smaller models or running inference scripts for larger models.
- You can fine-tune smaller models entirely on Colab.
- However, time limits may prevent many epochs of training, so you may need to save model weights after each epoch to prevent progress loss.
- More effective to experiement with different learning rates and batch sizes for small models on Colab.
