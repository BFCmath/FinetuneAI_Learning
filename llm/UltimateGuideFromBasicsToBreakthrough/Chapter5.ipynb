    "+ Optimal Learning Rate: Use a lower learning rate, typically between 1e-4 to 2e-4, to ensure stable convergence. A learning rate schedule, such as learning rate warm-up followed by a linear decay, can also be beneficial. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Batch Size Considerations: Opt for a batch size that balances memory constraints and training efficiency. Smaller batch sizes can help in achieving faster convergence but may require more frequent updates. Conversely, larger batch sizes can be more memory-intensive but may lead to more stable updates. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Save Checkpoints Regularly: Regularly save model weights at various intervals across 5-8 epochs to capture optimal performance without overfitting. Implement early stopping mechanisms to halt training once the model performance starts to degrade on the validation set, thereby preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilise hyperparameter tuning methods like grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimisation to find the optimal set of hyperparameters. Tools such as Optuna, Hyperopt, and Ray Tune can automate this process and help in efficiently exploring the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Data Parallelism and Model Parallelism: For large-scale training, consider using data parallelism or model parallelism techniques to distribute the training workload across multiple GPUs or TPUs. (Horovod and DeepSpeed)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Regular Monitoring and Logging: Implement robust monitoring and logging to track training metrics, resource usage, and potential bottlenecks. Tools like TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, and MLflow can provide real-time insights into the training process, allowing for timely interventions and adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Handling Overfitting and Underfitting: Ensure that your model generalises well by implementing techniques to handle overfitting and underfitting. regularisation techniques such as L2 regularisation, dropout, and data augmentation can help prevent overfitting. Conversely, if your model is underfitting, consider increasing the model complexity or training for more epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Use Mixed Precision Training: Mixed precision training involves using both 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point types to reduce memory usage and increase computational efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Evaluate and Iterate: Continuously evaluate the model performance using a separate validation set and iterate on the training process based on the results. Regularly update your training data and retrain the model to keep it current with new data trends and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Documentation and Reproducibility: Maintain thorough documentation of your training setup, including the hardware configuration, software environment, and hyperparameters used. Ensure reproducibility by setting random seeds and providing detailed records of the training process. "
