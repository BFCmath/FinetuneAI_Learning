# How to effectively fine-tune small AI models using Kaggle.

## Load Data and Workflow
- Kaggle has a fast data upload speed.
- You should zip the data before uploading to save time.
- For weights/outputs after training, I recommend saving them in the output folder (as notebook or as dataset) and reusing them in the next session. This will save time and avoid re-uploading.

## Fine-tuning Strategy on Kaggle
Make sure you don't have to spend limited GPU resources on testing scripts (use Colab for that).
### Large Models
- For large models, consider fine-tuning one epoch at a time.
- This approach helps conserve resources, allows you to monitor the training process, and reduces the risk of overfitting. 
- Kaggle supports output workflows, so you can save the weights and optimizer state in the output folder and reuse them in the next session without re-uploading.
### Small Models
- For small models, I recommend preparing a well written fine-tune script that can run in many epochs in one go. 
- You should apply early stopping, and save the weights after each epoch. 

After fine-tuning, you can download the weights and upload them to Colab for inference. (Optional)
