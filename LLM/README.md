# LLM fine-tuning

## Introduction

This document summarizes my learnings and experiences with fine-tuning Large Language Model models. The goal is to create a concise, revisitable resource that simplifies understanding and implementation of fine-tuning techniques for LLMs.

Currently, I only summarize and note down Fine-tuning techniques for LLMs without detailed implementation.

## Papers

You can check this awesome paper/book [The Ultimate Guide to Fine-Tuning LLMs from Basics to Breakthroughs](papers\UltimateGuideFromBasicsToBreakthrough) to get more information about fine-tuning technique.
