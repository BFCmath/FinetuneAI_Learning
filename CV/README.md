# Computer Vision Fine-Tuning

## Introduction

This document summarizes my learnings and experiences with fine-tuning computer vision models. The goal is to create a concise, revisitable resource that simplifies understanding and implementation of fine-tuning techniques for computer vision tasks.

Currently, the focus is on CNN-based models. However, I plan to expand this to include other architectures in the future.

## Frameworks

I primarily use two frameworks for fine-tuning CNN-based models:

- **TensorFlow**  
- **PyTorch**

Detailed step-by-step guides for fine-tuning and transfer learning using these frameworks are available in the following notebooks:  

- [TensorFlow Guide](Tensorflow.ipynb)
- [PyTorch Guide](Pytorch.ipynb)

## YOLO

You can check [Ultralytics notebook](Ultralytics.ipynb) to get more information about finetune YOLO models both using Python's library and command line.

## TODO

- [X] Add git clone way for Ultralytics notebook.
